## Instructions for Compiling, Running, and Using the Program

<br/>

### 1. Install dependencies

Before running the program, make sure you have installed the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file. To install the dependencies, open the terminal, navigate to the project directory, and run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all the necessary dependencies.

### 2. Run the program

After installing the dependencies, you can run the program by running the main.py file. To run the program, open the terminal, navigate to the project directory, and run the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will start the program and run the optimization algorithm.

### 3. Use the program

When you run the program, you will be presented to a menu, in which you can run a visual simulation.

While the algorithm runs, the visualization will change dinamically. When it finishes running, you will get a warning in the console and the final state will be presented.

You can change the algorithm parameters in the `.env` file. It is documented, so it should be straightforward enough to use.
